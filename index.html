# Analysis-of-blood-cell-changes-in-sepsis
This is a comprehensive R software output of statistical analysis of laboratory data from septic patients, focusing on the changes in blood cell parameters that occur during sepsis. 
This study aimed to elucidate key hematological alterations associated with sepsis and enhance the interpretation of laboratory findings in clinical diagnosis. 
The analysis involved meticulous data wrangling to ensure the accuracy, completeness and consistency of the data. 
Factor analysis was used to identify patterns and relationships among hematological variables, allowing for a clearer understanding of blood cell changes in sepsis. 
This rigorous analytical framework has provided meaningful insights into diagnostic pattern of change of blood cells in sepsis.
The findings contribute to improving the interpretation of laboratory results,enabling more precise and timely diagnosis. 
Moreover, by identifying informative pattern of blood cell changes in sepsis, this study offers valuable infromation that may contribute to future researchwork in this field. 
The results of this study will serve as a useful resource for clinicians, researchers and healthcare policy makers seeking to optimze sepsis diagnosis and management. 
Corrections, contributions and collaborations that may enhance the clinical utility of these findings are welcome.

With thanks.
